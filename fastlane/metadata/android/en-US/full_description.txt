Tiny app to change Wi-Fi state via broadcast.
Useful to bypass Google limitation on apps targeting API 29 and higher.

After toggling it ON, to change Wi-Fi state you have to send broadcast to
"me.lucky.wyfy/.ControlReceiver" with the action below. Also you may require code authentication to
limit access to controller by clicking on the code block (red - disabled, yellow - enabled). While
authentication enabled you have to send this code in broadcast extra with the key "code".

Broadcasts can be sent with Key Mapper, apps for automation like Automate/Tasker/MacroDroid and so
on.

Actions:
* me.lucky.wyfy.action.SET_ON
* me.lucky.wyfy.action.SET_OFF

Permissions:
* CHANGE_WIFI_STATE - change Wi-Fi state
